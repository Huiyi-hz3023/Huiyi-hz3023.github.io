### This Huiyi's website

Hi! My name is Huiyi Zhu, and I am a second-year Master of Science student in Epidemiology at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. I previously earned a dual degree in Biology and Epidemiology from Indiana University Bloomington. My research interests focus on chronic diseases and maternal–child health, with a particular emphasis on how early-life exposures affect long-term health outcomes. I am currently involved in several research projects related to perinatal epidemiology, biological aging, and chronic disease risk.
